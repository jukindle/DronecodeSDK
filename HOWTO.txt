About example1

Our code is located in DronecodeSDK/KnightsOfNyquist. Here, you find the folder example1. In that folder, a cpp script is written, called example1.cpp

One compiles that script and executes it afterwards.

1. Compile the script
	source compile.sh
A new folder build is generated.
2. Switch to build folder
	cd build
3. Execute the executable in there with the IP addr of the drone (in our case, the simulator)
	./example1 udp://:14540
