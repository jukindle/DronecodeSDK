Prepare everything

1. Open Terminal
2. Create new folder
	mkdir RoboDroneRace
3. Switch to that folder
	cd RoboDroneRace
	
	
Install dependencies

1. Update stuff
	sudo apt-get update -y
2. Install stuff
	sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential colordiff astyle git libcurl4-openssl-dev libtinyxml2-dev doxygen -y


Setting up DronecodeSDK

1. Clone the repository
	git clone https://github.com/jukindle/DronecodeSDK.git
2. Change directory
	cd DronecodeSDK
3. Checkout master branch
	git checkout master
4. Pull master branch
	git pull
5. Clone all subrepositories
	git submodule update --init --recursive


Compile the SDK system wide

1. Clean everything
	make clean
2. Compile default stuff
	make default
3. Apply system wide
	sudo make default install

Install the simulator

1. Go to DronecodeSDK folder
2. Execute installer
	source install_simulator.sh
	


================= Now, you're ready to go! =================

Launch the simulator

1. Go to Simulator folder
	cd ~/RoboDroneRace/PX4Firmware/Firmware

About example1

Our code is located in DronecodeSDK/KnightsOfNyquist. Here, you find the folder example1. In that folder, a cpp script is written, called example1.cpp

One compiles that script and executes it afterwards.

1. Compile the script
	source compile.sh
A new folder build is generated.
2. Switch to build folder
	cd build
3. Execute the executable in there with the IP addr of the drone (in our case, the simulator)
	./example1 udp://:14540
